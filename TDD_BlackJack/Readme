Hi!

I make a TDD project about a dice game called Yahtzee. Here is the link of rule: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee

I apologize that the project name is not correct, because at first I did BlackJack, but I failed many times, so I changed to Yahtzee.
And I'm not good at Github and once all my files are deleted automatically in the repo and Eclipse, which made me fear to change any thing in my repo.
Sorry again, if it makes you feel inconvenient.
